## Recipes & Ratings Exploratory Data Analysis
Analysis done by Paul J. Losiewicz
### Introduction
  In the modern age of technology, the landscape for creating and sharing culinary arts and traditions has been made more accessible than ever.  No longer do amateur and professional cooks have to pass down age-old recipes by word-of-mouth or scribbles jotted down on a pad of paper. The internet allows cooks of all disciplines to share their own unique work and recieve widespread and almost instantaneous feedback; for this reason, we can readily explore the trends and discover insights on what make certain recipes popular as opposed to others and what sets a group of digital culinary publishers from the rest.

  Our dataset in question comes from food.com and originally featured two separate sections of raw data detailing recipes and reviews posted since 2008.  The raw recipe data originally featured 83,782 unique rows of recipes including column-values of recipe-names, recipe ID, preparation time, contributor id, date of submission, related tags, nutrition information, number of steps, and the detailed instructions and descriptions for each given recipe.  On the other hand, the raw ratings datatset originally came with 731,927 row-values which all feature a unique rating for any given recipe in the recipes-dataset.  The ratings dataset included information on user ID, recipe ID for the specified rating, posting-date, rating, and the actual review text.  

  This project consists of several steps, all detailed in the respective sections below.  We start by cleaning the dataset: there will be a more detailed description of this process further down the page.  Generally, I combined the ratings and reviews data-sets on the recipe ID column, essentially merging the recipe data onto each unique review. Afterwards, analysis is done on certain isolated column values of our combined-dataset, exploring the distrobution of given columns and the potential relationships that may exist between independent column values. Additionally, I conduct an analysis on the missingness of the "ratings" collumn, essentially focusing on the reasons why certain row-values may appear as N/A.  Finally, we round this project off by conducting permutation-tests on the research question posed-below.

  As mentioned earlier in this section, the exploration and accessibility of the culinary arts has changed significantly since the emergence of websites like food.com.  Websites and repositories like food.com allow anyone from amateurs to educated culinary-professionals to share whatever they want for willing consumers to make their own personal-spins of such recipes at home.  With such widespread accesibility and willing participation of both aspiring cooks on both-ends, this begs the question: *do more experienced food.com users recieve higher-ratings than those who publish in passing?*  By "more experienced food.com users", I am generally referring to contributors who have published at least 5 unique recipes to food.com, and by "those who publish in passing", I refer to those who have not.  This question bears a few observations to consider when framing a hypothesis with this data.  First, I wonder if those who just post a couple recipes recieve higher ratings due to uniqueness; for example, I can imagine that certain food.com users publish recipes that have been passed down through generations, and as a result, they share their recipe in passing as opposed to publishing myriads of recipes.  In addition, I wonder if food.com contributors who have published greater than 100 recipes do so as the loss of quality.  The over-arching question being explored here is *quality vs. quantity*, and by using the hundreds of thousands of unique-rows of data, I hope to draw some meaningful conclusions on this topic.
