# Recipes & Ratings Exploratory Data Analysis
Analysis done by Paul J. Losiewicz
## Introduction
	In the modern age of technology, the landscape for creating and sharing culinary arts and traditions has been made more accessible than ever.  No longer do amateur and professional cooks have to pass down age-old recipes by word-of-mouth or scribbles jotted down on a pad of paper. The internet allows cooks of all disciplines to share their own unique work and recieve widespread and almost instantaneous feedback; for this reason, we can readily explore the trends and discover insights on what make certain recipes popular as opposed to others and what sets a group of food.com publishers from the rest.
